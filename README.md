# CalcMachine
Basic and Light Calculator Program made in C#

How to Use:

CalcMachine opens with a splash text ordering you to write the two numbers you want to use, it receives any INTEGER number under the 32-bit integer.

In the following examples, we will be using 5 and 2 as our numbers for all 4 basic operations:

The program supports only the 4 basic operations at the moment, but I plan on adding more further on.

Inputting the number of the operation on the menu makes the system do said operation, as the following images show:

The most important thing to note on in regard to this program is that it can Output float values (without the f in the end for readability)
This is made for avoiding innacurate divisions that may arrive from the lack of float support.
